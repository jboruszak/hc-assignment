### What's the difference between fetch, pull, and push?

Fetch, pull, and push are git commands you can use to sync your local and remote projects.

| Command | From remote to local | From local to remote | Merges remote and local |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---:|
| `git fetch` | &check; | &#88; | &#88; |
| `git pull` | &check; | &#88; | &check; |
| `git push` | &#88; | &check; | &check; |

#### git fetch ####
`git fetch` checks your current branch to find out if a tracking branch exists. Then, it checks for changes in the remote branch and pulls them into the tracking branch. It doesn't change your local branch. To merge those changes into your local branch, you need to use `git merge`.

#### git pull ####
`git pull` performs `git fetch` followed immediately by `git merge`.

`git fetch` and `git pull` are similar commands, but `git pull` does two things. Use git fetch followed by git merge when you need to make sure you understand the changes you'll merge into the local branch before the merge happens.

#### git push ####
`git push` checks your current branch to find out if it's connected to a tracking branch for a remote repository. Then, it pushes our local changes to the remote branch. `git push` is how you share code with a remote repository.

This command fails when commits in the remote branch aren't in your local branch. If your push fails, you need to synchronize your local branch with the remote branch with either a `git pull` command or a `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. Then, try your push again.
