### What's the difference between fetch, pull, and push?

| Command | From remote to local | From local to remote | Merges remote and local |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---:|
| `git fetch` | &check; | &#88; | &#88; |
| `git pull` | &check; | &#88; | &check; |
| `git push` | &#88; | &check; | &check; |

#### git fetch ####
`git fetch` checks your current branch to find out if a tracking branch exists. Then, it checks for changes in the remote branch and pulls them into the tracking branch. It doesn't change your local branch. To merge those changes into your branch, you need to do `git merge origin/master` for the "master" branch, which is probably also called "master".

#### git pull ####
`git fetch` and `git pull` are similar commands. But `git pull` does two things.

`git pull` does a `git fetch` followed immediately by `git merge`. Some people prefer to use git fetch followed by git merge to make sure they understand the changes they'll merge into their branch before the merge happens.

#### git push ####
`git push` takes our current branch, and checks to see whether or not there is a tracking branch for a remote repository connected to it. If so, our changes are taken from our branch and pushed to the remote branch. This is how code is shared with a remote repository, you can think of it as "make the remote branch resemble my local branch". This will fail if the remote branch has diverged from your local branch: if not all the commits in the remote branch are in your local branch. When this happens, your local branch needs to be synchronized with the remote branch with git pull or git fetch and git merge.
