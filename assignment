### What's the difference between fetch, pull, and push?

| Command | From remote to local | From local to remote | Merges remote and local |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---:|
| `git fetch` | &check; | &#88; | &#88; |
| `git pull` | &check; | &#88; | &check; |
| `git push` | &#88; | &check; | &check; |

#### git fetch ####
`git fetch` checks your current branch to find out if a tracking branch exists. Then, it checks for changes in the remote branch and pulls them into the tracking branch. It doesn't change your local branch. To merge those changes into your branch, you need to do `git merge origin/master` for the "master" branch, which is probably also called "master".

#### git pull ####
`git fetch` and `git pull` are similar commands. But `git pull` does two things.

`git pull` does a `git fetch` followed immediately by `git merge`. Some people prefer to use git fetch followed by git merge to make sure they understand the changes they'll merge into their branch before the merge happens.

#### git push ####
`git push` checks the current branch to find out if there's a tracking branch for a remote repository connected to it. Then, it pushes our local changes to the remote branch. This is how we share code with a remote repository. This will fail if the remote branch diverged from your local branch because some of the commits in the remote branch aren't in your local branch. When this happens, you need to synchronize your local branch with the remote branch by using either `git pull` or `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.
